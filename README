The Makefile in the root directory contains some common actions:

  make      - build and run the benchmark suite detailed in Util/Bench.hs; results written to dist/bm.html
  make test - build and run the test suite detailed in Util.Test.hs; results written to stdout.
  make prof - build and run the profiling example (Util/Profile.hs)

additionally, cabal builds the haskell library+documentation:
  cabal clean/configure/build/haddock/install
