The Makefile in the root directory contains some common actions:

  make      - build and run the benchmark suite
  make test - build and run the test suite
  make prof - build and run the profiling example (Util/Profile.hs)

additionally, cabal builds the haskell library+documentation:
  cabal clean/configure/build/haddock/install
