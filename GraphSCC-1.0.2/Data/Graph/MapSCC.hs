-- | Implements Tarjan's algorithm for computing the strongly connected
-- components of a graph.  For more details see:
-- <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm>.
--
-- This implementation uses 'IntMap' instead of mutable arrays in the algorithm.
-- The benefit is that the implementation conforms to the Haskell 98 standard,
-- however, the algorithm is a bit slower on large graphs.

-- | Computes the strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph in O(???)
-- time.  The resulting tuple contains:
--   * A (reversed) topologically sorted list of SCCs.
--     Each SCCs is assigned a unique identifier of type 'Int'.
--   * An O(log(V)) mapping from vertices in the original graph to
--     the identifier of their SCC.  This mapping will raise an exception
--     if it is applied to integers that do not correspond to
--     vertices in the input graph.
--
-- This function assumes that the adjacency lists in the original graph
-- mention only nodes that are in the graph. Violating this assumption
-- will result in an exception.
